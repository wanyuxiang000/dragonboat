	// snapshotting.
	//
	// When SnapshotEntries is set to N, it means a snapshot is created for
	// roughly every N applied Raft log entries (proposals). This also implies
	// that sending N log entries to a follower is more expensive than sending a
	// snapshot.
	//
	// Once a snapshot is generated, Raft log entries covered by the new snapshot
	// can be compacted. See the godoc on CompactionOverhead to see what log
	// entries are actually compacted after taking a snapshot.

	// NodeHost.RequestSnapshot can be called to manually request a snapshot to
	// be created to capture current node state.

	// SyncRequestSnapshot methods to manually request snapshots.
	SnapshotEntries uint64
	// CompactionOverhead defines the number of most recent entries to keep after
	// each Raft log compaction. Raft log compaction is performance automatically
	// every time when a snapshot is created.
	//
	// For example, when a snapshot is created at let's say index 10,000, then all
	// Raft log entries with index <= 10,000 can be removed from that node as they
	// have already been covered by the created snapshot image. This frees up the
	// maximum storage space but comes at the cost that the full snapshot will
	// have to be sent to the follower if the follower requires any Raft log entry
	// at index <= 10,000. When CompactionOverhead is set to say 500, Dragonboat
	// then compacts the Raft log up to index 9,500 and keeps Raft log entries
	// between index (9,500, 1,0000]. As a result, the node can still replicate
	// Raft log entries between index (9,500, 1,0000] to other peers and only fall
	// back to stream the full snapshot if any Raft log entry with index <= 9,500
	// is required to be replicated.
